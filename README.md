# EPL_predictor

Using data from the last two seasons, we will try to predict the team that will win this year's premier league title.

There are a lot of factors that are at play for a team to win the league. Some of these include:
Clean sheets
Goals scored
Goals conceded
Wins / Draws / Losses
Distance covered
Set piece conversion
Shot conversion ratio
Player availability
Tactical Adaptability
Wins from losing positions
Wins without conceding first
Summer signings' suitability 

All these and more will be considered in the creation of this year's premier league position predictor


Gathering the data to be used, I made use of the final table from each of the seasons considered from the official premier league website.
To get the xG of all teams from each of the seasons, I got data from Understat.com
